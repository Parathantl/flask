          "context": "The concept of graph databases traces back to Leonhard Euler. Euler was an 18th century Swiss mathematician who made several important discoveries in mathematics, such as infinitesimal calculus. In solving the “Seven Bridges of Königsberg” problem in 1736, Euler laid the foundations for graph theory. (He also got a fun shout-out in Hidden Figures when Euler’s Method was discussed.)\n\nWhen solving the “Königsberg” problem, Euler ignored the choice of route, claiming the route within each land mass was irrelevant. Instead, his focus was on the sequence of bridges being crossed. With this shift in focus, he reset the problem in more abstract terms and laid the foundations for graph theory. He replaced the land masses with the abstract vertexes (called nodes in graph databases). Each bridge became an abstract connection, or “edge,” with the edge representing the relationship between the two vertexes (or land masses) connected by that bridge. His resulting mathematical structure was called a graph.\nWANT TO STAY IN THE KNOW?\n\nGet our weekly newsletter in your inbox with the latest Data Management articles, webinars, events, online courses, and more.\nSubscribe\n\nIn the modern world, a graph database is essentially a collection of nodes and edges. Each node contains descriptions of entities or objects – such as a person, business, or automobile – and each edge represents descriptions of the relationships between the nodes.\n\nFor instance, an internet business must use GDPR policies when dealing with their customer base. Having a policy when dealing with customers can be represented using the internet business as a node, the customer as a node, and the GDPR as the connecting edge, or their relationship. Relationships between nodes can be expressed as a unidirectional relationship. “Internet business-GDPR policy-customer” can be expressed on a graph with the edge connecting the internet business node to the customer node.\nThe Uses of Graph Databases\n\nThe flexibility of graph databases and their focus on relationships are the two key factors explaining the recent surge of popularity in graph databases. The need to generate insights from the existing data supports a database technology that places a high priority on relationship information.\n\nOddly, traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) handle data relationships very poorly. The rigid schemas they use make it difficult to change connections or add new business requirements. Graph databases, on the other hand, store data relationships efficiently, but are also flexible. \n\nThey allow for the easy expansion of data models and adjust readily to changing business needs. \n\nThe graph databases are often used for Customer 360, Recommendation and personalization, Asset management, Fraud detection, Social networks, Graph databases have become a popular tool for mining data from social media sources. They can also be useful when working with data that involves complex relationships, such as identifying and creating recommendations along the lines of “customers who bought this also looked at…”\n\nWhen the goal is to gain insights about business relationships, graph databases are a good choice. Graph databases can provide insights into customer interests and help create messages for certain clients. These systems can help businesses create accurate, well-rounded customer profiles. \n\nGraph databases are especially useful when an application’s data model needs to support: ‘Many-to-many’ relationships, The high value of relationships, Low latency at large scale, Heterogeneous data \n\nWhen Not to Use a Graph Database: Transactional data, where relationships have no importance, Simplistic lists (data that is fixed and tabular), Complicated commands, such as “List all clients with incomes over $200K between the ages of 20 and 40,” should not be performed on a graph database, because they cannot respond to “multi-faceted” commands.\n\nGraph databases are not designed for optimal performance when scanning bulk data or using unknown start points. If queries are scanning tables for a match or seeking data fitting a general category, graph solutions are not the best-suited for the task. Graph databases are designed and built for finding relationships through the use of a starting data point. They are not designed for searching an entire graph without a specific starting point.\n\nBLOBs and CLOBs do not work well with graph databases. While graph databases are good at maintaining relationships between different small data entities, they are not designed to store several properties on one node. While a query can move from entity to entity very quickly, it takes time to pull out the details from each entity.\nGraph Storage\n\nGraph data processing systems can use a variety of storage mechanisms. When storage is designed specifically for graph-like data, it is called a native graph database. A graph database using native graph storage is optimized for graphs during every step of the process. This assures the data is efficiently stored with connecting nodes and relationships.\n\nNon-native graph databases store data using other systems. For example, some use a relational engine, storing the graphed data within a table. Others use wide column storage – a type of NoSQL database. Because of their design, these databases save information about relationships in a location far from their associated node. This non-native approach leads to slow processing, because the storage layer isn’t designed for graph associations. Other systems use key-value storage, or document-oriented databases, putting them in the category of NoSQL systems.\nDifferent Types of Database Graphs\n\nGenerally speaking, graph solutions offer the most efficient method of analyzing data that is highly-connected when seeking possible (hidden or obvious) connections. Graphs can offer a more natural perspective on some data. Graphs are often used as an easy way to find trends within data because data is presented symbolically rather than being displayed numerically as a table. Graphs allow complicated data to be displayed and interpreted much more easily than a data table.\n\nDifferent kinds of graphs include: Social graph, Intent graph, Consumption graph, Interest graph, Mobile graph, Property graph, Knowledge graphs\n\nSocial graph: Focused on the connections between people. This type of graph is intuitive and widely used. The well-known concept of “six degrees of separation” can be mapped with a social graph. Twitter and Facebook use social graphs.\nIntent graph: Expresses reasoning and motivation, expressing intent.\nConsumption graph: This graph is used heavily in the retail industry and tracks the consumption of each individual customer. Also called the payment graph.\nInterest graph: Maps an individual’s interests and is often used with a social graph.\nMobile graph: Uses mobile data to create various graphs and charts.\nProperty graph: A directed multigraph. An object can be attached to each node and edge on a Property Graph. It can use multiple parallel edges which share the same source and destination node. The use of parallel edges can help in expressing multiple relationships.\nKnowledge graphs: Google is well-known for its Knowledge Graph and uses it to enhance their search engine’s results, using information taken from a variety of resources. The information is shown to users with an info box alongside the search results. Knowledge Graph information is often used when Google Assistant and Google Home answer spoken questions. TigerGraph and Neo4j also offer knowledge graphs.\n\nThere are a wide variety data graphs available, with new ones being developed as needed. Graphs and charts have helped to identify unknown trends and make informed decisions. Modern technology has promoted an explosion of new ways to visualize and present patterns and trends. The variety of ways graphs can be used to express useful information are limited only by imagination. Gaurav Deshpande, from TigerGraph, said in a DATAVERSITY® interview:\n\n    “Whenever customers ask me about it, I keep it very simple. When you hear the word ‘graph,’ graph is equal to relationship. So any time you are trying to do analysis of relationships, that’s where you should use the graph database. And given that all of us are increasingly more connected to each other, both as people and as organizations, as entities. It just makes sense that graph databases would become more prominent and more important as time goes by.”\n\nGraph Databases and AI: Because of their design, knowledge graphs capture and store information related to people, things, processes, applications, and data, and the relationships connecting them. They also provide evidence supporting the strengths of the relationships. These relationships provide context, which can be very helpful in training artificial intelligence.\n\nKnowledge graphs differ from data warehouses and data lakes in terms of operational convenience. A data warehouse is useful for static business insight projects, but knowledge graphs can provide powerful insights in real time, such as real-time recommendations, knowledge sharing, and fraud detection. These characteristics make graph databases and knowledge graphs ideal tools for Deep Learning techniques when training Artificial Intelligence. \n",

          "context": "Jamstack is a popular web development philosophy that aims to speed up both web development and the time it takes to download a web page. Drawing from devops and CI/CD, Jamstack upends long-held techniques for building interactive web pages, shifting load-time code execution away from web servers and toward in-browser JavaScript and external services accessed via APIs. The end result is a developer-friendly approach to building static websites that render very quickly and can be easily customized for multiple platforms.\n\n\nThe Jamstack architecture\n\nJamstack is a web application architecture based on three pillars, which provide the initials in its name: JavaScript, APIs, and markup. Web pages on a Jamstack site consist of standard markup language, so they can be built and tested anywhere, without dependencies on application servers or server-side technologies like Node.js. Any interactive functionality is provided by standard JavaScript code that executes in the browser, which makes calls to reusable APIs over HTTPS. These calls are used to access external data or any other functionality that can’t be built into the web page itself.\n\nTo understand why Jamstack is revolutionary, consider the LAMP stack, which exemplifies the way most developers have thought about web development for the last 15 years. LAMP stands for Linux (the operating system that powers most web servers), Apache (the server software running on those Linux machines), MySQL (the database where web application data is stored), and PHP/Perl/Python (the language used to write the server-side code). When you point your browser to a LAMP-based website, the web server executes the server-side code that generates the web page on the fly, drawing data as needed from the MySQL database.\n\nThe LAMP architecture lets developers create dynamic and interactive websites, but it also requires a powerful web server—and the more traffic a site gets, the more server-side computing power it needs. Even with a fully featured server, dynamic web pages can take a long time to build and load. In a world of people with short attention spans, who are often browsing the web on their phones, that delay has become a major pain point.\n\nJamstack was born as part of the static website movement, which arose in the mid 2010s as a reaction against this traditional model of how a website should work. To understand Jamstack, you need to understand the technology behind static websites.\nStatic websites and Jamstack\n\nIf you had to explain to a complete newbie how the web works, it might go something like this: Somewhere in a web server’s filesystem there are HTML files, accessible by HTTP addresses, which a web browser downloads and then interprets to create a web page. But that’s a description of a static website: It assumes the HTML files already exist when the web browser goes looking for them. But much of the web over the past decade was dominated by dynamic websites, which generate HTML files on the fly in response to web requests, often based on parameters passed to the web server via forms or in the URL itself.\nStatic site generators\n\nIn the very early days of the web, when web pages were invariably static, many web developers wrote HTML code by hand. As web pages grew more complex, tools like Macromedia’s Dreamweaver arrived and began to generate static HTML pages programmatically. As the static website movement took off, a new wave of static site generators began to emerge, including Gatsby, Hugo, and Jeckyll. Unlike WYSIWYG tools like Dreamweaver, static site generators are command-line driven and designed to integrate well with CI/CD processes. HTML files are generated by these tools, often based on content written in Markdown, and automatically uploaded to a version control repository like GitHub. As these files are marked ready for production, static pages on the live website are automatically updated.\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind is that static in this context doesn’t imply simple web 1.0 pages that aren’t interactive. These pages can include advanced JavaScript that executes in the browser and makes API calls to databases, server-side functionality, or hosted serverless functions. But because none of that execution happens on the web server, a static site doesn’t need an industrial-powered web host complete with a database. Many static sites are deployed to content delivery networks, or CDNs, where content is mirrored on multiple servers around the world in order to be delivered quickly to users anywhere.\n\nMathieu Dionne, marketing lead at Snipcart, describes the early days of this new world of static websites in a blog post, and mentions that around 2015, \"the Netlify founders ... had just come up with the term 'Jamstack' to work around the negative connotation of 'static web.'\"\n\nWe've described the Jamstack process throughout this section. Now, let's briefly discuss Netlify and its role in the Jamstack ecosystem.\n\nNetlify and Jamstack\n\nNetlify is a cloud computing and web hosting company, and its cofounder, Mathias Biilmann, coined the term Jamstack. Netlify’s services are tailored to customers who want to build sites based on the Jamstack philosophy.\n\nNetlify claims to have cracked a specific problem that had been holding back static websites, which is cache invalidation. Database-driven dynamic websites may consume a lot of server resources, but you can be certain that they’ll serve up the latest version of your website to any visitor who stops by. Because Jamstack websites are often hosted on the multiple distributed servers of a CDN, updates are less straightforward. It can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours for each CDN server to figure out that its cached version of the site is no longer valid. To work around this problem, Netlify’s CDN provides instant cache invalidation for HTML files.\n\nIn the years since Netlify raised the Jamstack flag, the company has used the technology as the backbone of its PaaS offering, providing a content platform for big companies like Nike and Peleton.\nJamstack with Gatsby\n\nNetlify isn’t the only hosting provider in the Jamstack space, and it doesn’t have any kind of trademark or proprietary control over the term. A variety of Jamstack hosting and deployment solutions are available, and most of the big cloud providers are getting in on the action, including Amazon Web Services, Google Firebase, and Microsoft Azure. Other, more specialized companies have also entered this space, including Gatsby, Inc., creator of the static site generator of the same name.\n\nGatsby (the company) has built a high-flying services offering on the back of the Gatsby site generator. Because of its open source roots, the Gatsby site generator is also offered by other service providers, including Netlify.\n\nThe headless CMS\n\nOf course, getting a website built and hosted is just the beginning, as you know if you've ever had to manage a website. You also need a way to create new content and add it to your site. Because the people doing that typically aren't programmers, they’ll need a user-friendly tool—namely, a content management system, or CMS. Traditional CMSes, like WordPress, offer a back-end user interface (UI) where you can enter website content, manage a database where that content is stored, and build dynamic web pages that present that content in response to browser requests.\n\nCMSes for Jamstack sites work differently, and they are generally known as headless. A headless CMS offers a UI for entering and managing content and a database or other means of storing it, but does not itself generate HTML code for a browser to parse. Instead, the website’s static HTML pages use JavaScript to make calls to the CMS’s APIs, and the CMS returns the content in a format that JavaScript can turn into a web page.\n\nThis system thoroughly separates content from presentation, which of course is a longstanding ideal of programming. Because the CMS has an accessible API, multiple web pages can easily use it. For instance, if you’ve built separate mobile, desktop, and smartwatch versions of your website, all of these versions can access the same content stored in the CMS.\n\nNetlify, as you might expect, has its own offering in this space, called NetlifyCMS, but there are other offerings available; developer Nebojsa Radakovic breaks them down in his introduction to headless CMSes. There are a lot of up-and-comers on that list, as well as one very familiar name. While we used WordPress as an example of a traditional CMS, it can also be run as a headless CMS to power a Jamstack site.\n\nWhy use Jamstack?: Speed, Developer experience, Flexibility\n\nWe've touched on many of the benefits to using Jamstack but it's worth recapping them, now that you have a full picture:\n\nSpeed: Static sites load more quickly—and that isn't just a matter of convenience. Google penalizes slow sites by lowering their search rank, and customers accustomed to quick responses often abandon ecommerce transactions if steps are slow to load.\nDeveloper experience: Developers can build static sites using the devops techniques that have transformed the industry's practices and productivity. And the Jamstack philosophy produces site stacks that cleanly separate concerns, allowing developers to focus on their areas of specialization front-end designers and developers can build sites without needing to be fluent in a server-side language, while back-end developers can focus on APIs. Content questions are fully handled in the realm of the CMS.\nFlexibility: Static sites can be hosted by traditional web servers, CDNs, specialized services, or some combination of the three. And because headless CMSes interact with front ends via APIs, you can easily build sites for multiple platforms that share the same content.\n\nWhen not to use Jamstack\n\nWith all those benefits, it still needs to be said that Jamstack isn't for everyone. The flipside of Jamstack being tailored to developer needs is that, if you want to run a Jamstack-based site, you will be more reliant on developers than you might want. This isn't so bad for companies that already have or are willing to hire a dedicated web development team with the skills necessary for Jamstack. But many smaller shops are accustomed to using off-the-shelf commercial or open source software that lets them run their websites with little need for day-to-day developer involvement. Ecommerce sites, in particular, tend to rely on a wide variety of plugins and libraries developed over the years for traditional web hosting solutions; their Jamstack equivalents aren't as widespread or mature, meaning that Jamstack is not always good for ecommerce.\nIs Jamstack popular?\n\nDespite the hype surrounding it, Jamstack currently backs a fairly small sliver of all websites. The Web Almanac estimated that, in 2021, sites built by static site generators (almost all of which would have been built along the lines of the Jamstack philosophy) made up only about 1 percent of all websites. That said, Jamstack is in a period of rapid growth, with its market share growing by a factor of more than two every year for the past three years. One big sign of increasing developer interest in the technology: about a third of Jamstack developers are quite new to the scene, having fewer than two years of experience.\nJamstack tutorials\n\nHasura, a company that focuses on the GraphQL API system used by Gatsby and other Jamstack platforms, has a good high-level tutorial that takes you step-by-step through the architectural considerations and choices that go into a Jamstack site. The web host Digital Ocean has a good tutorial on building a Jamstack portfolio site using Angular and Scully. Netlify offers a video tutorial that covers a lot of ground from the basics to more advanced topics, and include an introduction to building a database-driven Jamstack site.\n\nOnce you’ve mastered the basic concepts outlined here, you’ll be ready to use Jamstack principles and technologies for your websites.

          "context": "abstract: Something that exists as an idea or thought but not concrete or tangible (touchable) in the real world. Beauty, love and memory are abstractions; cars, trees and water are concrete and tangible. (in publishing) A short summary of a scientific paper, a poster or a scientist’s talk. Abstracts are useful to determine whether delving into the details of the whole scientific paper will yield the information you seek.\n\napp: Short for application, or a computer program designed for a specific task.\n\napplication: A particular use or function of something.\n\nartificial intelligence: A type of knowledge-based decision-making exhibited by machines or computers. The term also refers to the field of study in which scientists try to create machines or computer software capable of intelligent behavior.\n\nbias: The tendency to hold a particular perspective or preference that favors some thing, some group or some choice. Scientists often “blind” subjects to the details of a test (don’t tell them what it is) so that their biases will not affect the results.\n\ncomputer program: A set of instructions that a computer uses to perform some analysis or computation. The writing of these instructions is known as computer programming.\n\ncomputer science: The scientific study of the principles and use of computers. Scientists who work in this field are known as computer scientists.\n\ndata: Facts and/or statistics collected together for analysis but not necessarily organized in a way that gives them meaning. For digital information (the type stored by computers), those data typically are numbers stored in a binary code, portrayed as strings of zeros and ones.\n\ndiagnose: To analyze clues or symptoms in the search for their cause. The conclusion usually results in a diagnosis — identification of the causal problem or disease.\n\nelectricity: A flow of charge, usually from the movement of negatively charged particles, called electrons.\n\nintelligence: The ability to collect and apply knowledge and skills.\n\nmachine learning: A technique in computer science that allows computers to learn from examples or experience. Machine learning is the basis of some forms of artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, a machine-learning system might compare X-rays of lung tissue in people with cancer and then compare these to whether and how long a patient survived after being given a particular treatment. In future, that AI system might be able to look at a new patient’s lung scans and predict how well they will respond to a treatment.\n\nonline: (n.) On the internet. (adj.) A term for what can be found or accessed on the internet.\n\nsearch engine: (in computing) A computer program that allows a computer to search for information on the Internet. Common examples include Google, Yahoo and Bing.\n\nself-driving car: Also known as a driverless car or autonomous vehicle. These cars pilot themselves based on instructions that have been programmed into their computer guidance system.\n\ntechnology: The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry — or the devices, processes and systems that result from those efforts.\n\nvirtual: Being almost like something. An object or concept that is virtually real would be almost true or real — but not quite. The term often is used to refer to something that has been modeled — by or accomplished by — a computer using numbers, not by using real-world parts. So a virtual motor would be one that could be seen on a computer screen and tested by computer programming (but it wouldn’t be a three-dimensional device made from metal). (in computing) Things that are performed in or through digital processing and/or the internet. For instance, a virtual conference may be where people attended by watching it over the internet.\n\n",

These two libraries can be used for the same tasks.\n\nScikit-learn provides a large library for machine learning. The tools for text preprocessing are also presented here.\n\nGensim is the package for topic and vector space modeling, document similarity.\n\nThe general mission of the Pattern library is to serve as the web mining module. So, it supports NLP only as a side task.\n\nPolyglot is the yet another python package for NLP. It is not very popular but also can be used for a wide range of the NLP tasks.\n\nText to speech: TTS is an assistive technology that reads digital Text aloud. TTS can translate words on a computer or other digital device into audio with a single click of a button or a finger’s touch. TTS is extremely beneficial to both children and adults who have difficulty reading, and it can assist with writing, editing, and focusing.\n\nHow does Text-to-speech work?\n\nIt usually works by installing a speech recognition program like Speechify on your device or as a browser extension. Without lag, they must examine the words on the page and read them aloud. You can change the default voice to a custom voice, add accents, change languages, and even modify the speaking rate. It has come a long way in synthesized voices. It can recognize structured Text and adjust the tone accordingly. The days of synthetic agents are long gone. Speechify is changing that. You can convert Text to speech from any website within your browser, read your email aloud, and more after using the TTS mobile app. You can accomplish the same thing if you install it as a browser extension. Other significant companies, such as the news and entertainment industries, are starting to include speech as a feature on their websites.\n\nImage captioning in AI is the task of taking/inputting an image to an AI model, and receiving a text caption describing/summarizing the contents of the image as its output.\n\nData science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data and apply knowledge from data across a broad range of application domains. \n\nData Scientist Requirements: Math & Statistics, Domain Knowledge & Soft Skills, Programming & Database, Communication & Visualization \n\nSupervised learning is the type of machine learning in which machines are trained using well “labeled” training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output.\n\nThe labeled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.\n\nThe aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y).\n\nSupervised learning can be used for Risk Assessment, Image classification, Fraud Detection, Spam Filtering, etc. \n\nTypes of Supervised Machine learning Algorithms: Regression- Regression algorithms are used if there is a relationship between the input variable and the output variable. Classification- Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-false, etc.\n\nMost Famous Supervised Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting\n\nGradient boosting is a type of machine learning boosting. It relies on the intuition that the best possible next model, when combined with previous models, minimizes the overall prediction error. The key idea is to set the target outcomes for this next model in order to minimize the error.\n\nA decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes.\n\nSupport Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.\n\nThe k-nearest neighbor’s algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.\n\nThis type of statistical model (also known as the logit model) is often used for classification and predictive analytics. Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn’t vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables.\n\nLinear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable’s value is called the independent variable.\n\nMost Famous Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: Clustering\n\nClustering is most famous unsupervised learning algorithm. Its main purpose is grouping similar data points into same groups.\n\nClustering algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information.\n\nTypes of Clustering algorithm: Hierarchical Clustering, K - means, Fuzzy Clustering, Mixture Models\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a technique to bring out strong patterns in a dataset by suppressing variations. \n\nPCA is an unsupervised technique used to reduce the dimensionally of high-dimensional datasets while preserving the original structure and relationships between data.\n\nArtificial Neural Networks are normally called Neural Networks (NN). Neural networks are in fact multi-layer Perceptron's. Neural nets are most commonly used as a supervised learning algorithm but there are some cases when they used in unsupervised learning manner.for example: Koehnen's Self Organizing Map (KSOM)\n\n\n",

          "context": "artificial intelligence: A type of knowledge-based decision-making exhibited by machines or computers. The term also refers to the field of study in which scientists try to create machines or computer software capable of intelligent behavior.\n\ndata: Facts and/or statistics collected together for analysis but not necessarily organized in a way that gives them meaning. For digital information (the type stored by computers), those data typically are numbers stored in a binary code, portrayed as strings of zeros and ones.\n\ndiagnose: To analyze clues or symptoms in the search for their cause. The conclusion usually results in a diagnosis — identification of the causal problem or disease.\n\nengine: A machine designed to convert energy into useful mechanical motion. Sometimes an engine is called a motor. (in computer science) A computer program that performs a particular, narrow range of functions.\n\nenvironment: The sum of all of the things that exist around some organism or the process and the condition those things create. Environment may refer to the weather and ecosystem in which some animal lives, or, perhaps, the temperature and humidity (or even the placement of things in the vicinity of an item of interest).\n\nintelligence: The ability to collect and apply knowledge and skills.\n\nmachine learning: A technique in computer science that allows computers to learn from examples or experience. Machine learning is the basis of some forms of artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, a machine-learning system might compare X-rays of lung tissue in people with cancer and then compare these to whether and how long a patient survived after being given a particular treatment. In future, that AI system might be able to look at a new patient’s lung scans and predict how well they will respond to a treatment.\n\nreinforcement: Some consequence that guides the future behavior of an animal or person. If a rat presses a lever and receives a food pellet, that food pellet becomes a reinforcement of lever-pushing — it’s the reward that will teach the rat to press the lever again.\n\nreinforcement learning: An approach to teaching in which an animal or a person learns to perform a specific task to achieve a desired reward.\n\nreward: (In animal behavior) A stimulus, such as a tasty food pellet, that is offered to an animal or person to get them to change their behavior or to learn a task.\n\nsearch engine: (in computing) A computer program that allows a computer to search for information on the Internet. Common examples include Google, Yahoo and Bing.\n\nself-driving car: Also known as a driverless car or autonomous vehicle. These cars pilot themselves based on instructions that have been programmed into their computer guidance system.\n\nsocial media: Digital media that allow people to connect with each other (often anonymously) and to share information. Examples include Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp.\n\nsystem: A network of parts that together work to achieve some function. For instance, the blood, vessels and heart are primary components of the human body's circulatory system. Similarly, trains, platforms, tracks, roadway signals and overpasses are among the potential components of a nation's railway system. System can even be applied to the processes or ideas that are part of some method or ordered set of procedures for getting a task done.\n\ntechnology: The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry — or the devices, processes and systems that result from those efforts.\n\nvirtual: Being almost like something. An object or concept that is virtually real would be almost true or real — but not quite. The term often is used to refer to something that has been modeled — by or accomplished by — a computer using numbers, not by using real-world parts. So a virtual motor would be one that could be seen on a computer screen and tested by computer programming (but it wouldn’t be a three-dimensional device made from metal). (in computing) Things that are performed in or through digital processing and/or the internet. For instance, a virtual conference may be where people attended by watching it over the internet.\n",

API\nAPI stands for Application Programming Interface.\nAn API is a way to interact with external software or resource.\nAn API is an abstraction between two components. These two components are an application and a web server on the other side. The API will serve to handle data transfer between the two components.\n\n2. Compiler: A compiler is a program that turns a high-level language (such as Java) into a low-level language (machine code) that the computer can understand.\n\n3. Cache: A cache is part of either hardware or software responsible for temporarily storing information. We use cache to improve performance, especially when there is the need for constant access to data.\n\n4. Client-Server Architecture: A client is a piece of hardware (or software) that uses resources that a server makes available to use. A server is a computer program that serves as a provider of information. It makes resources available to the client. A Client-server model is a computer architecture where the server delivers the client's resources.\n\n5. Refactor: Refactor means changing the structure of a piece of code without affecting its behaviour and functionality.\n\n6. HTTP: HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is a communication protocol (rules and procedures for computers to communicate). HTTP is how we transfer information over the World Wide Web.\n\n7. Unit Testing: Unit Testing is a type of software testing where software engineers test the smallest \"uni\" of a piece of software.\n\n8. Framework / Library\nA framework is a structure from which you can start creating software.\nA library is a set of reusable code, and the software engineer decides when he needs to make use of a library.\n\n9. Load Balancing: Load Balancing is a concept you'll often hear when talking about System Design. It is a process used to spread the network traffic across several servers. We use load balancers to address performance and availability issues, especially when we have to handle many requests from the users.\n\n10. CI / CD\nCI stands for Continuous Integration.\nCD stands for Continuous Delivery (or deployment).\n\nContinuous Integration/Continuous Deployment is a set of rules, principles and procedures used to deliver applications to end-users by including more automation in the development process.\n\nENVIRONMENT: When software engineers create software, they do that through different \"scenarios\" before the product reaches the end-users. Those scenarios are known as environments.\n\nThere are different environments in software engineering: Development environment, Staging environment, Production environment\n\nDevelopment environment: you can run the code on your local machine with no harm.\nStaging environment: this environment is a copy of the end application. Software engineers use this environment for testing purposes. Any change doesn't affect customers' data.\nProduction environment: this is the end product that customers use. Any change can affect customers' data.\n\nHOTFIX: A hotfix is a fix that software engineers do urgently when they need to repair some issues in the current release, and they can't wait 'til the next release.\n",

This can give you peace of mind that the software is safer.\nImprove as a Programmer - Reading the open-source software code may help you improve as a programmer. You can get a grasp of what is good and what is not so good. You can read other people's code, which can help you pick up new skills and give you a chance to critique code written by others.\nSave Time & Money- Sometimes, open-source software might do just about everything you need and is only missing a few features. You can extend the open-source software to bridge the gap between what it does and what you need. Extending the existing software is much faster and cheaper than building new software because you require just a few new features and is cheaper than purchasing proprietary (closed source) software that may be suitable for your needs.\nCommunity - With open-source software comes a community of maintainers and users. It is also nice to have a community to benefit from. Whether you need help figuring something out about the software or sharing your ideas with others for the software, nothing beats a sense of community.\n",

          "context": "Kubernetes is a powerful container management tool that mechanizes the sending and the executives of holders. Kubernetes (k8's) is the following enormous wave in distributed computing and it's not difficult to see the reason why as organizations relocate their foundation and engineering to mirror a cloud-Native, information-driven period.\n\nWhether you're a Developer, Data Scientist, Product Manager, or something different, it won't damage to have a little Kubernetes information in your back pocket. It's one of the most sought-after abilities by organizations, everything being equal, so assuming that you're hoping to acquire another expertise that will remain with you all through your vocation, then learning Kubernetes is an extraordinary choice.\n\nContainer orchestration\n\nContainer are perfect. They give you a simple method for bundling and conveying administrations, consider process disengagement, unchanging nature, effective asset usage, and are lightweight in creation.\n\nYet, with regards to really running holders underway, you can wind up with handfuls, even a huge number of compartments over the long run. These compartments should be conveyed, made due, associated, and refreshed; if you somehow happened to do this physically, you'd require a whole group devoted to this.\n\nIt's adequately not to run holders; you should have the option to:\n\n    Coordinate and arrange these secluded parts\n    Increase and scale down in light of the interest\n    Make them issue lenient\n    Give correspondence across a bunch\n\nYou could inquire: aren't holders expected to do all that? The response is those holders are just low-level pieces of the riddle. The genuine advantages are acquired with devices that sit on top of holders — like Kubernetes. These apparatuses are today known as holder schedulers.\n\nGreat for multi-cloud adoption\n\nWith a significant number of the present organizations equipped with microservice engineering, it's nothing unexpected that compartments and the devices used to oversee them have become so well known.\n\nMicroservice engineering makes it simple to part your application into more modest parts with holders that can then be run on various cloud conditions, giving you the choice to pick the best host for your requirements.\n\nWhat's perfect about Kubernetes is that it's worked to be utilized anyplace so you can convey to public/private/crossover mists, empowering you to arrive at clients where they're at, with more noteworthy accessibility and security. You can perceive how Kubernetes can assist you with staying away from possible dangers with \"seller secure\".\nDeploy and update applications at scale for faster time-to-market\n\nKubernetes permits groups to stay up with the prerequisites of current programming advancement. Without Kubernetes, huge groups would need to prearrange their own organization work processes physically.\n\nHolders, joined with a coordination instrument, give the executives of machines and administrations for you — working on the dependability of your application while decreasing how much time and assets are spent on DevOps.\n\nKubernetes has a few extraordinary highlights that permit you to send applications quicker considering versatility:\n\n    Flat framework scaling: New servers can be added or eliminated without any problem. Auto-scaling: Automatically change the quantity of running compartments, in view of CPU usage or other application-gave measurements.\n\n    Manual scaling: Manually scale the quantity of running holders through an order or the connection point. Replication regulator: The replication regulator ensures your bunch has an equivalent measure of units running. In the event that there are such a large number of cases, the replication regulator ends the additional units. Assuming there are excessively scarcely any, it begins more units.\n\n    Wellbeing checks and self-mending: Kubernetes can check the soundness of hubs and holders guaranteeing your application runs into no disappointments. Kubernetes likewise offers self-recuperating and auto-substitution so you don't have to stress over on the off chance that a holder or case comes up short.\n\n    Traffic directing and load adjusting: Traffic steering sends solicitations to the fitting compartments. Kubernetes likewise accompanies worked in load balancers so you can adjust assets to answer blackouts or times of high traffic.\n\n    Robotized rollouts and rollbacks: Kubernetes handles rollouts for new adaptations or updates without margin time while checking the compartments' wellbeing. On the off chance that the rollout goes poorly, it consequently moves back.\n\n    Canary Deployments: Canary organizations empower you to test the new sending underway in lined up with the past form.\n\n    \"Before Kubernetes, our foundation was so out of date it was taking us over a half year to convey another microservice. Today, another microservice takes under five days to send. Furthermore, we're dealing with getting it to 60 minutes.\" — Box\n\nBetter management of your applications\n\nContainers allow applications to be broken down into smaller parts which can then be managed through an orchestration tool like Kubernetes. This makes it easy to manage codebases and test specific inputs and outputs.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Kubernetes has built-in features like self-healing and automated rollouts/rollbacks, effectively managing the containers for you.\n\nTo go even further, Kubernetes allows for declarative expressions of the desired state as opposed to an execution of a deployment script, meaning that a scheduler can monitor a cluster and perform actions whenever the actual state does not match the desired. You can think of schedulers as operators who are continually monitoring the system and fixing discrepancies between the desired and actual state.\n\nBenefits or advantages of using kubernetes are: can use it to deploy your services, to roll out new releases without downtime, and to scale (or de-scale) those services, portable, can run on a public or private cloud, can run on-premise or in a hybrid environment, can move a Kubernetes cluster from one hosting vendor to another without changing (almost) any of the deployment and management processes, Kubernetes can be easily extended to serve nearly any needs. You can choose which modules you’ll use, and you can develop additional features yourself and plug them in, Kubernetes will decide where to run something and how to maintain the state you specify, Kubernetes can place replicas of service on the most appropriate server, restart them when needed, replicate them, and scale them, Self-healing is a feature included in its design from the start. On the other hand, self-adaptation is coming soon as well, Zero-downtime deployments, fault tolerance, high availability, scaling, scheduling, and self-healing add significant value in Kubernetes, You can use it to mount volumes for stateful applications, It allows you to store confidential information as secrets, You can use it to validate the health of your services, It can load balance requests and monitor resources, It provides service discovery and easy access to logs.\n\nWhen to use Kubernetes: If an application uses a microservice architecture, looking to transition to a microservice architecture then Kubernetes will suit well because it’s likely already using software like Docker to containerize the application, suffering from slow development and deployment, unable to meet customer demands due to slow development time, then Kubernetes might help\n\nRather than a team of developers spending their time wrapping their heads around the development and deployment lifecycle, Kubernetes (along with Docker) can effectively manage it for you so the team can spend their time on more meaningful work that gets products out the door.\n\n“Our internal teams have less of a need to focus on manual capacity provisioning and more time to focus on delivering features for Spotify.”—Spotify\n\nLower infrastructure costs\n\nKubernetes uses an efficient resource management model at the container, pod, and cluster level, helping you lower cloud infrastructure costs by ensuring your clusters always have available resources for running applications.\nWhen you shouldn’t use Kubernetes\nSimple, lightweight applications\n\nIf your application makes use of a monolithic architecture it may be tough to see the real benefits of containers and the tool used to orchestrate them.\n\nThat’s because the very nature of a monolithic architecture is to have every piece of the application intertwined — from IO to the data processing to rendering, whereas containers are used to separate your application into individual components.\nCulture doesn’t reflect the changes ahead\n\nKubernetes notoriously has a steep learning curve, meaning you’ll be spending a good amount of time educating teams and addressing the challenges of a new solution, etc. If you don’t have a team that’s willing to experiment and take risks then it’s probably not the choice for you.\n",
